In vim, undoing is not linear!
every time you undo action A, and then do action B, you can actually go back to when you had done action A!
Ways to do this:
    :earlier {n} to go back to older state n times.
    :earlier {n}s to go back in time n seconds.
    {n}g- to go back to earlier state n times.
    g+ to go forward!
