- Setup defx:
    - Get nvim python3 support:
        install python3.
        install pynvim (pip install pynvim).

- Set language servers:
    Generally you can use mason.nvim for that. Its configs specify what servers to auto install,
        and for other servers you can use :LspInstall <server>  .
        However, manual installation is still possible.

    - ccls: after installation, add the ccls executable to PATH (symlink it
            to /usr/bin).
        Installation problems: on WSL, you might need to install some or all of the following:
            libclang-8-dev, zlib1g-dev, libncurses-dev, rapidjson-dev, libclang-dev, llvm-8,
            llvm-8-tools, llvm-8-runtime.
        Used for:
            - c,cpp completion with coc.

    - clangd: Usually installable through the package manager either in its own packages or
        through something like "clang-extra-tools".

    - pylsp: `pip install python-lsp-server`.

    - black: either `pip install black` or `pip install python-lsp-black`.

    - lua-language-server: either through the package manager if available, through mason plugin,
        or by cloning the git repo and trying to compile and run:
        https://github.com/sumneko/lua-language-server
