- Setup defx:
    - Get nvim python3 support:
        install python3.
        install pynvim (pip install pynvim).

- Setup Coc:
    - Get nvim node.js support:
        install node.js and npm
        intall neovim from npm (npm install neovim)

    - Set language servers:
        - ccls: after installation, add the ccls executable to PATH (symlink it
                to /usr/bin).
            Installation problems: on WSL, you might need to install some or all of the following:
                libclang-8-dev, zlib1g-dev, libncurses-dev, rapidjson-dev, libclang-dev, llvm-8,
                llvm-8-tools, llvm-8-runtime.
            Used for:
                - c,cpp completion with coc.

        - MPLS: install the extension coc-python.
            After that, if you just open vim coc will prompt you to download the linters. its better
                to do it yourself. just pip3 install {flake8,pydocstyle,mypy,yapf}.

    - Download extensions (:CocInstall <ext name>):
        - coc-lists: for file fuzzy finding, and other fuzzy finding lists.
        - coc-ultisnips: for completion integration with the real ultisnips plugin.
        - coc-python: for the MPLS lsp for python.

- Setup gruvbox8:
    - copy the colors dir to init.vim's dir.
    - put this: 'let g:gruvbox_italics = 0' at the end of $VIMRUNTIME/syntax/syntax.vim.
        This is to cancel italics which make the terminal a bit slower i think (just a feeling).
