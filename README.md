# init.vimango

My personal Neovim configurations.
This repository was created for personal usage.

Main guidelines:
  - Highly Documented and well organized.
  - Portable - everything is in a single directories tree!
  - Follows most of /r/vim's best practices guide.
  - Minimizing the number of plugins:
    - No unused plugins.
    - No duplicate plugins.
    - Prefer builtin features over plugins when results are similar.
  - Scaleable: No features that only work for small code bases and break or become unuseable for bigger ones.

Features:
  - Summaries of great vim-related articles in my_wiki.
  - Language specific supports: cpp, python.
  - Easy use of tabpages, buffers and windows. Each used the way it was meant to be.
  - Useful, efficient and consistent shortcuts for many actions.
