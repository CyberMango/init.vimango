# init.vimango

My personal Neovim configurations.
This repository was created for personal usage.

Main guidelines:
  - Highly Documented and well organized.
  - Portable - everything is in a single directories tree!
  - Follows most of /r/vim's best practices guide.
  - A minimal number of plugins.

Features:
  - Summaries of great vim-related articles in my_wiki.
  - Language specific supports: cpp, python.
  - Easy use of tabpages, buffers and windows. Each used the way it was meant to be.

TODOs:
  - Finish configuring defx.nvim:
    * Add shortcuts for more actions like: open in split/vertical/tabpage, new dir, new file etc.
    * Make it always open on the left and full screen width.
    * Make it the default vim file explorer.
    * Make the cursor invisible.
  - setup coc.nvim:
    * cpp lsp with ccls.
    * python lsp with kite.
    * fuzzy finding with coclists.
